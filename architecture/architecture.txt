ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW – Secure Resume Hosting

1. Amazon S3 (Storage Layer)
   - Used to store resume PDF securely
   - Public access blocked to prevent unauthorized access
   Reason:
   S3 public buckets are a common security risk. Keeping the bucket private
   ensures better control and follows security best practices.

2. Amazon CloudFront (Delivery Layer)
   - Used to deliver content securely and efficiently
   Reason:
   CloudFront provides HTTPS, global access, and acts as a secure gateway
   instead of exposing S3 directly.

3. Origin Access Control (OAC)
   - Allows only CloudFront to access the S3 bucket
   Reason:
   Prevents users from bypassing CloudFront and accessing S3 objects directly.

4. Security Controls
   - HTTPS enforced for encrypted communication
   - AWS WAF enabled in monitor mode
   Reason:
   Protects against common web vulnerabilities and allows traffic monitoring.

5. Access Flow
   User → CloudFront (HTTPS) → S3 (Private Bucket)
