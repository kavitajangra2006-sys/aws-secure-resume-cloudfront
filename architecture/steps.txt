IMPLEMENTATION STEPS WITH REASONS

1. Created a private S3 bucket
   - Uploaded resume PDF
   - Enabled Block Public Access (4/4 ON)
   Reason:
   Prevents accidental data exposure and enforces private storage.

2. Configured CloudFront distribution
   - Selected S3 bucket as origin
   - Enabled Origin Access Control (OAC)
   Reason:
   Ensures S3 content is accessible only through CloudFront.

3. Applied S3 bucket policy
   - Used AWS-generated policy to allow CloudFront access
   Reason:
   Allows secure service-to-service access without making the bucket public.

4. Enabled security settings
   - HTTP to HTTPS redirection
   - AWS WAF enabled in monitor mode
   Reason:
   Encrypts data in transit and monitors potential web attacks.

5. Testing and troubleshooting
   - Verified direct S3 access returned AccessDenied
   - Verified CloudFront HTTPS access worked correctly
   - Fixed issues related to object naming and cache invalidation
   Reason:
   Ensures the solution works as expected and follows security principles.

6. Cleanup
   - Deleted AWS resources after testing
   Reason:
   Avoids unnecessary AWS costs and respects free-tier limits.
